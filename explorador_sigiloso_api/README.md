üß† Mental Model: ‚ÄúFollowers‚Äù as Periodic Observers
Think of a follower like a personal or shared agent that tracks a thing over time and stores a log of its changes. In your case:

The "thing" being followed = Bitcoin price, NEAR validator performance, etc.

The follower object = A persistent record that configures what to follow, who owns it, how often it refreshes, and whether it's public or private.

The follower log = Historical snapshots (one per refresh) of the followed entity.
